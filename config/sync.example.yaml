  # IMPORTANT: Replace this URL with your PRIVATE Git repository for syncing Cursor settings
  # ‚ö†Ô∏è  SECURITY NOTICE: This MUST be a private repository to protect your sensitive data
  # üîë AUTHENTICATION: Requires GitHub Personal Access Token (set with: cursor-sync token <your-token>)
  # üöÄ AUTO-CREATION: If the repository doesn't exist, cursor-sync will automatically create it as private
  # 
  # Cursor settings may contain:
  # ‚Ä¢ API keys and access tokens
  # ‚Ä¢ Personal workspace paths
  # ‚Ä¢ Extension configurations
  # ‚Ä¢ Custom snippets and templates
  #
  # BEFORE USING:
  # 1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  # 2. Grant 'repo' scope (Full control of private repositories)
  # 3. Save token with: cursor-sync token ghp_your_token_here
  # 4. Replace the URL below with your desired repository (will be created if it doesn't exist)
